# black-square-algorithm

You are given an N Ã— N matrix in which every cell is colored black or white. 
Columns are numbered from 0 to N-1 (from left to right). This coloring is represented by a non-empty array of integers A. 
If the K-th number in the array is equal to X then the X lowest cells in the K-th column of the matrix are black. 
The rest of the cells in the K-th column are white

### Examples:
1. Given A = [1, 2, 5, 3, 1, 3],  the function should return 2.
2. For example, the black square of side 2 contains the two lowest rows of the 1st and 2nd columns (counting from 0).
